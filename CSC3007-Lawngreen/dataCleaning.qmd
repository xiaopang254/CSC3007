## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

# File paths
input_file_path <- "../data/original_dataset.csv"
output_file_path <- "cleaned_data.csv"

# Read the CSV file and skip the first 9 rows
data <- read_csv(input_file_path, skip = 9)

# Reassign the 10th row as column headers
colnames(data) <- data[1,]
data <- data[-1,]

# Select rows up to row 123 (Skipped 9 rows, 121 - 9 = 112)
data <- data[1:112,]

# Save the updated data to a new CSV file
write_csv(data, output_file_path)

# Display the contents of the CSV file
print(data)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
